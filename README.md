# FamilyShow
I have forked the Family show project from CodePlex, WPF in C#

This is a genealogy application

Here is an example:

**How to use this application:**

Go to the Release page:

https://github.com/fredatgithub/FamilyShow/releases

Download FamilyShow-Release-V3.4.zip file

Unzip it in a folder in your documents or wherever you want.

Go inside this folder and double-click on FamilyShow.exe

Click on the New menu

Add a first member of a family (e.g. you)

Add other persons of your family.


You can also download a sample family 

Go to the Sample Windsor Familly section between V3.0 and V3.1 in the Release page

Download  the file: **Family.Show-samplesWindsor_familly.zip** 

Unzip it to your folder

With the application, open this file: **Windsor.family**

Now you can see the Windsor family and add royal members if you like.
